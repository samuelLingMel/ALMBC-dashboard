## ALMBC Dashboard 2.0

NATIONAL DASHBOARD OVERVIEW

Businesses and sole traders in all states of Australia are currently navigating
fluctuating re-opening stages and COVID health and safety guidelines. With current
fluctuations in COVID restrictions at play, information is changing daily and updating
COIVD safety plans for businesses needs to happen fast.
Developing a COVID safety plan is essential for businesses to be compliant with
government safety requirements and to protect patrons and staff. Each business
must follow the guidelines relevant to the current restrictions of their state or
Jurisdiction, whilst also developing a plan tailored to the nuances of their business
and/or business premises.

Thousands of recovery plans are being developed by state and local government
and small to medium businesses within the live music sector. For the thousands of
businesses in the live music sector around the country, referencing COVID safety
plans from government and other businesses will provide significant assistance in
guiding the development of their own COVID safety plan, tailored to their business
and compliant with the current restrictions that apply.

Currently, there is no easy way to obtain a collection of COVID safety plans from
similar businesses or organisations. Having ease of access to others’ COVID safety
plans enables a business or organisation to move fast in the development of their
COVID safety planning.

One of ALMBC’s priorities at present is the development of a national gig ready
dashboard – a centralised resource to obtain the many recovery plans in place
around the country, in accordance with varying restrictions and reopening
guidelines. ALMBC has a dedicated working group collating the data for this
dashboard, including Wardens in each state. These Wardens are collecting up to
date information when advice changes from respective state governments.
ALMBC partnered with General Assembly, collaborating with a UX designer and a software engineer to make the dashboard a reality.
